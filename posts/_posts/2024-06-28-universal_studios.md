I visited Universal Studios twice. On the first day (2024/06/28), I focused on experiencing different rides. If you are visiting alone, you should go directly to the Single Rider line which is free and a lot faster than the general line. On the second day (2024/07/04), my priorities were taking beautiful photos, which I will share later, and watching the special July 4th firework in the park and the amazing music light show at Hogwarts Castle. 

### Studio Tour

- King Kong 3D experience.
- Sound stage.
