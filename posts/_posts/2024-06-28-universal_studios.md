I visited Universal Studios twice recently. On my first visit, on June 28, 2024, I focused on experiencing different rides. If you’re visiting alone, I highly recommend heading straight to the Single Rider line—it's free and much faster than the general line. On my second visit, on July 4, 2024, my main priorities were taking beautiful photos (which I will share later), watching the special July 4th fireworks in the park, and enjoying the amazing music light show at Hogwarts Castle.
