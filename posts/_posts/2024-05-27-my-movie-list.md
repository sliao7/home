I work for a movie company. But I was never a big fan of movies until last summer in 2023 when some colleague and friend I met in NYC told me that movies disseminate various cultures and shape lives. Since then, I have started to watch more movies and will continue to do so. Therefore, it would be fun to list all the movies I've watched since the middle of last year, arranged chronologically according to my viewing dates. And I will keep adding movies to the list in the future! (Note: \*\* in a date means I can not figure out the exact date.)
