I'm thrilled to have finally designed and implemented an efficient data management system to record, store, and display my vocabulary! From now on, Iâ€™ll diligently collect new words I encounter and master them one by one right here! 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
For each word, the pronunciation symbols provided below are sourced from the [Merriam-Webster Dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dictionary). You may find the [Guide to Pronunciation](https://merriam-webster.com/assets/mw/static/pdf/help/guide-to-pronunciation.pdf) helpful in understanding these phonetic symbols.
