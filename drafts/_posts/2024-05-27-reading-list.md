- Find a book that I am interested in reading
- Find or create a good environment and a good chair or couch to sit on
- Enjoy the book
- Think about what the main message the author was trying to convey
- Try to relate the message to my own experience or knowledge
- Find a friend to share what I learned from the reading or share it with myself or write them in my mind or journal
