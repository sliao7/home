<p class="font-weight-bold"> This is a preliminary outline. I will provide more detailed information later. :)</p>>

### One strong desire

1. To record and share my thoughts and ideas

### Two free templates

1. Visual from [hashirshoaeb](https://github.com/hashirshoaeb/home)
2. Code (HTML, Jekyll, SCSS, and JavaScript) from [sbryngelson](https://github.com/sbryngelson/academic-website-template)

### Three awesome assistants

1. The best visual designer in the world
2. ChatGPT
3. Google

### Four online courses

1. CSS
2. HTML
3. JavaScript
4. Bootstrap

### Five weeks of devoted learning and working on weekday nights and weekends

Note: the last number is a close estimation.
