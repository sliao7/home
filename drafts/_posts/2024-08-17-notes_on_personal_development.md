## Five abilities to develop

1. **Absorb**: Pay attention.
2. **Respond**: Let life touch me. Let the emotions affect me as well as the sights. 
3. **Reflect**: To make the past more valuable to serve me for the future. Go back to what I did, what I read, what I heard, what I saw, and how I felt, to capture it so that it serves me.
4. **Act**: Take action when the ideas are hot and the emotions are high. Do the best I can.
5. **Share**: When somebody shares, everybody wins. Sharing expands my capacity. 

## Set goals

Goals are my vision of the future. Write my goals down and make a list. The price is easy if the promise is clear and powerful.
