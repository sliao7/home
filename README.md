This is a statically generated website built with Jekyll, Liquid, and Bootstrap.

I started with two templates, [hashirshoaeb/home](https://github.com/hashirshoaeb/home) and [sbryngelson/academic-website-template](https://github.com/sbryngelson/academic-website-template), and customized them into a personal website featuring an attractive `About` page and a dedicated `Blog` page.

This repository is for my personal use and is not intended to serve as a template. I may create a template repository in the future. In the meantime, please consider using the two well-maintained original templates.
