53,Sound of Music,1965-03-02,2024-09-07,Home(Bought on Youtube),20th Century Studios," I watched The Sound of Music because Reagan mentioned it was his favorite movie. The last time I saw it was over ten years ago. It's a classic film, full of fun and with a great love story. I admire how Maria is kind and stays true to herself, bringing energy and passion to everything she does. Her strong faith helps her face the challenges of the mischievous children and the strict, cold demeanor of the captain without fear."
52,Reagan,2024-08-30,2024-09-07,Regal,Showbiz Direct,"A friend recommended Reagan to me, and it was a great experience.

49,Deadpool & Wolverine,2024-07-26,2024-07-28,Studio Movie Grill,Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures,"Even without extensive knowledge of the Marvel Universe, I found it to be a fun movie.

After working for a movie company for 2.5 years and visiting three movie studios in Hollywood, I learned to take movie stories less seriously because I know they are fictional. The filmmakers just want us to enjoy ourselves!"

37,The Ten Commandments (part 1) (1956 film),1956-10-05,2024-06-06,Friends get-together,Paramount Pictures,"A great story from the Bible about Moses.

33,Unfrosted,2024-05-03,2024-05-09,Home(Netflix),Netflix,The jokes in the movie do not make much sense to me. I decided to watched it because of Seinfeld but was kinda disappointed. It was a relaxing comedy movie. You barely need to use your brain to watch it.
32,Call Me by Your Name,2018-01-19,2024-05-04,Home(Prime Video),"Sony Pictures Classics, Warner Bros. Pictures, United International Pictures, Memento Films","This is a quiet and romantic movie.
