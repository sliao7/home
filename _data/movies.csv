36,The Ten Commandments (part 1) (1956 film),1956-10-05,2024-06-06,Friends get-together,Paramount Pictures,"A great story from the Bible about Moses.

An IF can take any form and possess any skills the child desires. They can see and accompany each other. However, as children grow up, they often become busy with life and lose connection with their IF. This movie tells the story of an 11-year-old girl who helps IFs reconnect with their grown-up owners by rekindling cherished childhood memories."

However, this is just a story about the winner. What about other runners who didn't win the game? My friend provided a good point. This is just the story about this guy. Other people had their own life stories, and they won in their ways."
32,Unfrosted,2024-05-03,2024-05-09,Home(Netflix),Netflix,The jokes in the movie do not make much sense to me. I decided to watched it because of Seinfeld but was kinda disappointed. It was a relaxing comedy movie. You barely need to use your brain to watch it.
31,Call Me by Your Name,2018-01-19,2024-05-04,Home(Prime Video),"Sony Pictures Classics, Warner Bros. Pictures, United International Pictures, Memento Films","This is a quiet and romantic movie. My favorite lines are: ""We rip out so much of ourselves to be cured of things faster that we go bankrupt by the age of 30 and have less to offer each time we start with someone new. But to make yourself feel nothing so as not to feel anything. What a waste!"""
30,Begin Again,2014-06-27,2024-04-26,Home(P+),The Weinstein Company,"I love this movie, the story, and the music. It's a simple and warm story about self-growth and passion. The background in New York City reminds me of the good times I spent there last summer."
